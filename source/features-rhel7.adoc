= New features of RPM in RHEL 7

This list documents most noticable changes in RPM packaging between Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.

* A new command, ``rpmkeys``, used for keyring import and signature verification
has been added.

* A new command, ``rpmspec``, used for spec queries and parsed output has been
added.
* A new command, ``rpmsign``, used for package signing has been added.
* The ``posix.exec()``  and ``os.exit()`` extensions embedded in ``%{lua:...}``
scripts fail the script unless called from a child process created with the
``posix.fork()`` scriptlet.
* The ``%pretrans`` scriptlet failure causes the package installation to be
skipped.
* Scriptlets can be macro-expanded and queryformat-expanded at runtime.
* Pre-transaction and post-transaction scriptlet dependencies can now be
correctly expressed with ``Requires(pretrans)`` and ``Requires(posttrans)``
scriptlets.
* The ``OrderWithRequires`` tag for supplying additional ordering hints has been
added. The tag follows ``Requires`` tag syntax, but does not generate actual
dependencies. The ordering hints are treated as if they were ``Requires`` when
calculating the transaction order, only if the involved packages are present in
the same transaction.
* The ``%license`` flag can be used in the ``%files`` section. This flag can be
used similar to the ``%doc`` flag to mark files as licenses, which need to be
installed despite the ``--nodocs`` option.
* The ``%autosetup`` macro for automating patch application, with optional
distributed version control system integration has been added.
* The  automatic dependency generator has been rewritten into extensible and
customizable rule based system with built-in filtering.
* The OpenPGP V3 public keys are no longer supported.
