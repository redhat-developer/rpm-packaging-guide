[[hello-world]]
= Your First RPM Package

Creating an RPM package can be complicated. Here is a complete, working RPM Spec file with several things skipped and simplified.

[source,specfile]
----
Name:       hello-world
Version:    1
Release:    1
Summary:    Most simple RPM package
License:    FIXME

%description
This is my first RPM package, which does nothing.

%prep
# we have no source, so nothing here

%build
cat > hello-world.sh <<EOF
#!/usr/bin/bash
echo Hello world
EOF

%install
mkdir -p %{buildroot}/usr/bin/                                                                                                                                                      
install -m 755 hello-world.sh %{buildroot}/usr/bin/hello-world.sh

%files
/usr/bin/hello-world.sh

# let skip this for now
----

Save this file as ``hello-world.spec``.

Now use these commands:

[source,bash]
----
$ rpmdev-setuptree
$ rpmbuild -ba hello-world.spec

----

The command ``rpmdev-setuptree`` creates several working directories. As those directories are stored in $HOME, this command does not need to be used again. It needs to be run only once.

The command ``rpmbuild`` creates the actuall rpm package. The output of this command can be similar to:

The file ``/home/mirek/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/hello-world-1-1.x86_64.rpm`` is your first RPM package. It can be installed in the system and tested.
